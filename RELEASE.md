## Release Instructions

-   Use git to switch to a release branch (e.g. `release/<version>`).

-   Update version in `DESCRIPTION` file.

-   Update header and version in `NEWS.md`. Confirm recent changes are included.

-   Update auto-loaders (from R):

    ```r
    source("R/update.R"); updateInit()
    ```

-   Commit your changes!

-   Check and fix URLs (from R):

    ```r
    install.packages("urlchecker")
    urlchecker::url_check()
    ```

-   Generate a release `.tar.gz` by running the following command from the
    parent directory of your `packrat` repository:
    
    ```console
    R CMD build packrat
    ```

-   Test the package (also from the parent directory):

    ```console
    R CMD check --as-cran packrat_*.tar.gz
    ```
    
-   Test the package using [R-Hub](https://docs.r-hub.io). Triggered from R:

    ```r
    install.packages("rhub")
    rhub::check_for_cran()
    ```

-   Fix any issues identified by the previous steps. Rinse and repeat.

-   Submit to CRAN. Cross fingers.
    
-   After submission, squash-and-merge the `release/<version>` branch back to 
    `master`.

-   Create a git tag for your new release and push that tag.

    ```console
    git tag -a -m 'CRAN release: vX.Y.Z' vX.Y.Z COMMIT_HASH
    git push origin --tags
    ```

-   Create a GitHub release against that tag and include the NEWS.md items in
    its notes.

-   Create a branch to bump for development (e.g. `development/<version>`).

    Update `NEWS.md` with an "unreleased" version header and run the following
    command to update `DESCRIPTION` and the auto-loaders:
    
    ```console
    R -f configure.R
    ```

    Squash-and-merge this branch back to `master`.
