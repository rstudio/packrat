# NOTE: in versions of R < 4.0.0, normalizePath() does not normalize path
# casing; e.g. normalizePath("~/MyPaTh") will not normalize to "~/MyPath"
# (assuming that is the "true" underlying casing on the filesystem)
#
# we work around this by round-tripping between the short name and
# the long name, as Windows then has no choice but to figure out
# the correct casing for us
#
# this isn't 100% reliable (not all paths have a short-path equivalent)
# but seems to be good enough in practice ...
#
# except that, if the path contains characters that cannot be represented in the
# current encoding, then attempting to normalize the short version of that path
# will fail -- so if the path is already UTF-8, then we need to avoid
# round-tripping through the short path.
#
# furthermore, it appears that shortPathName() can mis-encode its result for
# strings marked with latin1 encoding?
