#' Show differences between the last snapshot and the library
#'
#' Shows the differences between the project's packrat dependencies, its private
#' package library, and its R scripts.
#'
#' These differences are created when you use the normal R package management
#' commands like \code{\link{install.packages}}, \code{\link{update.packages}},
#' and \code{\link{remove.packages}}. To bring these differences into packrat, you
#' can use \code{\link{snapshot}}.
#'
#' Differences can also arise if one of your collaborators adds or removes
#' packages from the packrat dependencies. In this case, you simply need to tell
#' packrat to update your private package library using \code{\link{restore}}.
#'
#' @param project The directory that contains the R project.
#' @param lib.loc The library to examine. Defaults to the private library
#' associated with the project directory.
#' @param quiet Print detailed information about the packrat status to the console?
#'
#' @return Either \code{NULL} if a \code{packrat} project has not yet been
#' initialized, or a (invisibly) a \code{data.frame} with components:
#' \item{package}{The package name,}
#' \item{packrat.version}{The package version used in the last snapshot,}
#' \item{packrat.source}{The location from which the package was obtained,}
#' \item{library.version}{The package version available in the local library,}
#' \item{currently.used}{Whether the package is used in any of the R code in the current project.}
