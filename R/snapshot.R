#' Capture and store the packages and versions in use
#'
#' Finds the packages in use in the project, and stores a list
#' of those packages, their sources, and their current versions in packrat.
#'
#' @param project The project directory. Defaults to current working
#'   directory.
#' @param available A database of available packages.
#' @param lib.loc The library to snapshot. Defaults to the private library
#'   associated with the given directory.
#' @param ignore.stale Stale packages are packages that are different from the
#'   last snapshot, but were installed by packrat. Typically, packages become
#'   stale when a new snapshot is available, but you haven't applied it yet with
#'   \code{\link{restore}}. By default, packrat will prevent you from taking a
#'   snapshot when you have stale packages to prevent you from losing changes
#'   from the unapplied snapshot. If your intent is to overwrite the last
#'   snapshot without applying it, use \code{ignore.stale = TRUE} to skip this
#'   check.
#' @param dry.run Computes the changes to your packrat state that would be made
#'   if a snapshot were performed, and prints them to the console.
#' @param prompt \code{TRUE} to prompt before performing snapshotting package
#'   changes that might be unintended; \code{FALSE} to perform these operations
#'   without confirmation. Potentially unintended changes include snapshotting
#'   packages at an older version than the last snapshot, or missing despite
#'   being present in the last snapshot.
#'
#' @note \code{snapshot} modifies the project's \code{packrat.lock} file, and
#' the sources stored in the project's \code{packrat/src} directory. If you
#' are working with a version control system, your collaborators can sync the
#' changes to these files and then use \code{\link{restore}} to apply your
#' snapshot.
#'
#' @seealso
#' \code{\link{restore}} to apply a snapshot.
#' \code{\link{status}} to view the differences between the most recent snapshot
#' and the library.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' # Take a snapshot of the current project
#' snapshot()
